# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms** journey — including clean code implementations, concept notes, and problem-solving approaches.

I’m using this repo to:
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills
- Build consistency in DSA practice
- Maintain well-structured notes for revision
- Prepare for coding interviews & assessments

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the problem clearly**
   - Read constraints and input/output format
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Restate the problem in your own words

2. **Identify edge cases early**
   - Empty input, single element
   - Maximum/minimum constraints
   - Duplicate values, negative numbers, overflow, etc.

3. **Think of a brute-force solution**
   - Start with the simplest possible approach
   - Focus on correctness over efficiency
   - Helps build a clear understanding of the problem

4. **Analyze brute-force complexity**
   - Time and space complexity
   - Identify the main bottleneck

5. **Optimize using appropriate DSA concepts**
   - **Data Structures:** Array, Hash Map, Stack, Queue, Heap, Tree, Graph
   - **Techniques:** Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Binary Search, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy

6. **Write clean, structured code**
   - Meaningful variable names
   - Modular and readable logic

7. **Analyze final time & space complexity**
   - Ensure it meets the given constraints

8. **Dry run with examples**
   - Test on pen-paper
   - Verify edge cases and corner scenarios


This helps me think clearly and explain solutions confidently in interviews.
